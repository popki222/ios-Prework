## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1 Messages: ability to pin contacts , ability to edit message.
2 Gmail: ability to sign in on multiple accounts , integration with other apps such as photo app.
3 Youtube: speeding up video playback , playing videos while not on the app.
4: Instagram: changing the background of a direct message , multiple account usage.
5: eBay: ability to sort searches , ability to search based on picture.

I would like to build an app that can recognize items through video or picture integration and then search for the item online and return what the items value is on an online marketplace. A feature that could be integrated is automatic listing on your preferred online marketplace.

## Notes

I had an issue with changing the text color at first.
